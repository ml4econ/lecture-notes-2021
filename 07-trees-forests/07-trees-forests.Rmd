# Two-way split of `lstat`

.pull-left[
Let $D_i$ denote an arbitrary two-way "split" dummy variable such that:
$$D_{i}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{ if } lstat_i > 15\\
0 & \text{ otherwise },

On the left, the blue step-function is the fitted value from running
$$medv_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \varepsilon_i$$
Note that the prediction is given by the average of $medv_i$ within each "region".

```{r twoway, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10, echo=FALSE}
boston %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lstat, medv)) +

# Three-way split

# Issues

In general using splits involve three main issues:

  1. Where to split?
  2. How many splits?
  3. How to predict within each node?
  
The answers to the these questions are related to the decision trees framework.

# Regression Trees

# Classification and regression trees (CART)

Basic idea (Breiman et al., 1984):

1. Split the features space $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{p}$ - into $M$ distinct and non-overlapping regions (rectangles), $R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{M}$.

2. For every observation that falls into the region $R_{j},$ we make the same prediction (regression or classification). For example, for a continuous $y$,
$$\hat{y}_{m}=\frac{1}{N_{m}} \sum_{x_{i} \in R_{m}} y_{i}$$
where $y_m$ is a test observation that belongs to region $R_m$.


---
# How to split?

- Going over every possible partitions of the feature space is infeasible. (Why?)

- Instead, the CART algorithm follows a __greedy__ approach.

- Starting with all of the data, consider a splitting variable $j$ and split point $s$, and define the pair of half-planes
$$R_{1}(j, s)=\left\{x | x_{j} \leq s\right\}, \qquad R_{2}(j, s)=\left\{x | x_{j}>s\right\}$$
- find the predictor $j^*$ and split $s^*$ that partitions the data into two regions $R_{1}(j^*,s^*)$ and $R_{2}(j^*,s^*)$ such that the overall sums of squares error are minimized:
$$\mathrm{RSS}=\sum_{i \in R_{1}(j^*,s^*)}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{1}\right)^{2}+\sum_{i \in R_{2}(j^*,s^*)}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{2}\right)^{2}$$
where $\bar{y}_{1}$ and $\bar{y}_{2}$ are the averages of the training set outcomes within each group.

---
# The CART Algorithm 

For each node, beginning with the root containing the full sample:

1. Determine the single $RSS$ minimizing split for this node.

2. Split this parent node into the left and right node.

3. Apply steps 1 and 2 to each child node.

4. Continue until you reach a leaf node of some prespecified minimum size (e.g., stop splitting when there are fewer than, say, 10 observations in each leaf).

]   


---
# How large should we grow the tree?

- Large tree - overfit. Small tree - high variance.

- The tree's level of _expressiveness_ is captured by its size (the number of terminal nodes).

- Common practice: Build a large tree and __prune__ the tree backwards using _cost-complexity pruning_.


---
# Cost-complexity pruning

The cost complexity criterion associated with a tree $T$ is given by

$$\mathrm{RSS}_{cp}(T)=\mathrm{RSS}(T)+cp|T|$$
where
  - $\mathrm{RSS}$ is the sum of squared error for tree $T$.
  - $|T|$ is the number of terminal nodes in tree $T$.
  - $cp$ is the complexity parameter.
  
Hence, for CART, the penalty is a function of the number of terminal nodes.


__NOTE:__ $cp$ and $|T|$ are analogous to $\lambda$ and $\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1$ in the lasso.

---
# $cp$

The complexity parameter is unit free and ranges from 0 to 1:

  - When $cp = 0$, we have a fully saturated tree.
  
  - When $cp = 1$, there are no splits, i.e, we predict the unconditional mean.
  

---
# Boston with $cp=1$

.pull-left[
The R implementation of the CART algorithm is called `{rpart}`. Estimating a tree is straightforward using the `rpart()` function:
```{r}
tree_fit <- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston,
  control = rpart.control(cp = 1)  #<<
)
```
Recall that setting $cp=1$ enforces no splits.

Plotting a tree is done using the `{rpart.plot}` package
```{r cp1, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 2)
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'cp1', echo=FALSE}

```
]

---
# Boston with $cp=0$

.pull-left[
```{r cp0, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
tree_fit <- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston,
  control = rpart.control(cp = 0, minsplit = 80) #<<
)
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 1)
```
Setting $cp=0$ results in a saturated tree. 

Note we've set the minimum split criterion to $80$ just to avoid clutter (too many splits) in the figure on the right.
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'cp0', echo=FALSE}

```
]

---
# Tuning $cp$

Breiman et al. (1984) suggest using a cross-validation approach to find the optimal<sup>*</sup> $cp$:

- For any value of the $cp$ there is a unique, subtree $T_{cp}$ that minimizes cost complexity $\mathrm{RSS}_{cp}(T)$.

- To find the best subtree, we evaluate the data across a sequence of $cp$ values. This process generates a (finite) sequence of subtrees which contains $T_{cp}$. 

- Estimation of $cp$ is achieved by cross-validation: we choose the value $\hat{cp}$ that minimizes the cross-validated $RSS$. Our final tree is $T_{\hat{cp}}$

.footnote[
[*] Breiman et al. (1984) also propose using the 1se heuristic, i.e., find the smallest tree that is within one standard error of the tree with smallest absolute error.
]


---
# Boston tree cross validation

.pull-left[
The `plotcp()` function from the `{rpart}` package gives a visual representation of the cross-validation results in an `rpart` object:
```{r cp_cv, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
tree_fit <- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston
)
plotcp(tree_fit)  #<<
```
$cp=0.029$ is the 1se optimal $cp$.
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'cp_cv', echo=FALSE}

```
]

---
# Boston pruned tree

.pull-left[
We now proceed to pruning the tree using the `prune()` function (also from `{rpart}`), where we set `cp = 0.029`:
```{r}
tree_prune <- prune(tree_fit, cp = 0.029) #<<
```

And now we can plot the pruned tree:
```{r cp_pruned, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
rpart.plot(tree_prune, cex = 2)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'cp_pruned', echo=FALSE}

```
]


---
# Trees with multiple features

.pull-left[
How would you partition the data?
```{r mult, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
boston %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lstat, rm, color = medv)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'mult', echo=FALSE}

```
]


---
# `rpart` with many features

.pull-left[
```{r tree2, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
tree_fit <- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat + rm,
  data = boston,
  control = rpart.control(cp = 0.15),
  method = "anova"
)
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 2)
```
For now, we will ignore the `cp = 0.15` argument.
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'tree2', echo=FALSE}

```
]


---
# Variable importance

- Once a tree has been estimated, it is common practice to assess the relative importance of the features to the prediction. 

- A popular measure of variable (feature) importance is the total amount that the $RSS$ is decreased due to splits over a given variable (Breiman et al., 1984.)

- Variables that appear higher or multiple times are more important than variable that appear lower in the tree or less frequently.


---
# Boston variable importance
.pull-left[
We now fit a tree with the entire set of features in the Boston dataset:
```{r}
tree_all_vars <- rpart(medv ~ ., data = boston)
```

We can easily show variable importance for the fitted tree with the help of the [`{vip}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vip/index.html) package:
```{r vip, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
vip(tree_all_vars)
```
`rm` (the number of rooms) is clearly the most important feature in predicting `medv`.

# Classification Trees

# Adjustment to classification tasks: Splits

- Instead of $RSS$, splits are typically based on the _Gini index_ (a.k.a _node purity_), defined by
$$G=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k}\left(1-\hat{p}_{m k}\right),$$
a measure of total variance across the total classes (this is `rpart`'s default.)

- An alternative to the Gini index is _cross-entropy_, given by
$$D=-\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k} \log \hat{p}_{m k}$$

---
# Adjustment to classification: Prediction

- Instead of predicting based on the average $y$ in region $R_m$, prediction is based on a majority rule: each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs.

---
# Adjustment to classification: Variable importance

- Variable importance is determined based on the amount that the Gini index/cross-entropy is decreased by splits over a given variable.

# Data details

In this lecture, we will focus on a single outcome and two features:

|  Variable  |  Role        |  Definition  |  Values                   |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------------------|
|  `survived`|  Outcome     |  Survival    |  0 = No, 1 = Yes          |
|  `age`     |  Feature     |  Age in years|                           |
|  `pclass`  |  Feature     |  Ticket class|  1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd|

Our goal: Predict which passengers survived based on their age and status.

---
# Preprocessing

For what will follow, it would be useful to remove `NA`s and define `survived` as a factor:
```{r}
titanic <-titanic_raw %>% 
  select(survived, age, pclass) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    survived = as_factor(survived),
  ) 

titanic
```

# Partition

How would you stratify the data?

titanic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pclass, age, color = survived)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) 
```

rpart_prune <- prune(rpart_model, cp = .038)

```{r titanic2, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
rpart.plot(rpart_prune, type=0, extra=1, cex = 2)

# Partitioning a 2-D feature space

.pull-left[
This is how the tree partitions the data
```{r titanic_tree, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
titanic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pclass, age, color = survived)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.8, size = 2) +
  geom_parttree(data = rpart_prune, aes(fill=survived), alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_minimal()
```
where I've used the `geom_parttree()` function from the [`{parttree}`](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/parttree) package (in development.)
]
.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label = 'titanic_tree', echo=FALSE}

```
]

---
# Recall: trees stratify the features space

Let's generate partition dummies that correspond to our tree's partitioning:
```{r}
titanic_lm <- 
  titanic %>% 
  mutate(
    survived = as.numeric(survived) - 1,
    class_3 = if_else(pclass == 3, 1, 0),
    class_1_or_2_age_below_16 = if_else(pclass %in% c(1,2) & age < 16, 1, 0),
    class_1_age_above_16 = if_else(pclass == 1 & age >=16, 1, 0),
    class_2_age_above_16 = if_else(pclass == 2 & age >=16, 1, 0),
  ) %>% 
  select(survived, starts_with("class_"))

titanic_lm %>% glimpse()
```

---
# Representing trees as linear regressions

.pull-left[
Now, we can estimate a linear model using our set of partition dummies and compare the results to our tree.
```{r}
lm(survived ~ . -1, data = titanic_lm) %>%
  tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, std.error)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Random Forests

# Trees: pros and cons

Pros:

- Intuitive (more than regression?) 

- Interpretable

- Nonparametric (no bookkeeping)

Cons:

- Overfit

- Poor predictive performance (typically)

---
# Random forests: Basic Idea

- Breiman (2001): Instead of using a single tree, average the predictions of several trees, fitted to bootstrapped training samples + use a subset of the feature space for each split.

- Intuition: Reduce variance (overfit) by averaging multiple noisy and weakly-correlated predictions.

---
# The random forests algorithm

Suppose $B$ is the number of bootstrapped samples, i.e., the number of trees in the forest (typically thousands.)

For $b=1 \ldots B$ :

  1. Sample with-replacement $n$ observations from the data.
  
  2. Grow a tree $T_{b}-$, where for each split, draw a subset of $m$ features (a common choice is $m \approx \sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is the dimension of $x$.)
  
  3. Use typical tree model stopping criteria to determine when a
tree is complete (but do not prune.)


---
# Making predictions

Regression forests:

- For each observation, predict based on the average of $B$ predictions, i.e., 

$$\hat{f}_{\mathrm{RF}}(x)=\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{f}^{* b}(x),$$
where $\hat{f}^{* b}(x)$ is the prediction based on sample $b$.

Classification forests:

- For each test observation, record the class predicted by each of the $B$ trees, and take a majority vote.


---
# Out-of-bag error estimation

- Because pf bootstrap, on average, each bagged tree makes use of
around two-thirds of the observations.

- Thus, we can use the remaining on-third observations as "out-of-bag" (OOB) validation set.

- This will yield, on average, $B$ predictions for the $i^{\text{th}}$ observation that belong to the OOB set.


---
# Fitting forests using `ranger`

Fitting forests in R is easy with the [`{ranger}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/ranger.pdf) package, which uses the same syntax as `{rpart}`.

```{r}
rf_fit <- ranger(
  formula = medv ~ .,
  data = boston,
  mtry = 3,
  num.trees = 1000,
  importance = "impurity"  
)
```
where

- `num.trees` is the argument for $B$, the number of trees.
- `mtry` is the argument for $m$, the number of features drawn before each split.

Note that the `importance` argument will be latter used to construct variable importance measures.


---
# The output of the model
```{r}
rf_fit
```

---
# Variable importance

.pull-left[
The idea is the same as in trees, only now we average the effect of a variable over the $B$ trees.
```{r rf_vip, fig.show='hide', fig.height=10}
rf_fit %>% 
  vip()
```
According to our forest, both `lstat` and `rm` outperform the other features.

# Bagging and Boosting

- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): same as random forest, only $m=p$. Inferior to random forests since trees are correlated.

- Boosting: This is an example of a _slow learner_ where each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. (can be estimated using the [`{gbm}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html) package.)


__Note:__ Boosting algorithms in general are very popular and are on the high-end of predictive performance.
