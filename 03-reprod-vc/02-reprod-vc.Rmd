# Replicating this Presentation

R packages used to produce this presentation

```{r load packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and plotting
library(tidymodels) # for modeling the tidy way
library(knitr) # for presenting tables
library(xaringan) # for rendering xaringan presentations
```

If you are missing a package, run the following command

```
install.packages("package_name")

```

Alternatively, you can just use the [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html) package that loads and installs packages:

```{r pacman, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(tidyvers, tidymodels, knitr, xaringan)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = TRUE,
  echo = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE
)

htmltools::tagList(rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome())
```

```{r plots_and_figures, include=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_gray(15))
```

```{r, references, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(RefManageR)
BibOptions(check.entries = FALSE, 
           bib.style = "numeric", 
           cite.style = "authoryear", 
           style = "markdown",
           hyperlink = FALSE, 
           dashed = FALSE)
bib <- ReadBib("refs/refs.bib", check = FALSE)
```

# RStudio Projects
------------------

# Reproducibility

- Reproducible research allows anyone to generate your exact same results. 

- To make your project reproducible you'll need to:

  - document what you did (code + explanations).
  - name the packages you used (including version numbers).
  - describe your R environment (R version number, operating system, etc.)
  
- Being in a "reproducible" state-of-mind means putting yourself in the shoes of the consumers, rather than producers, of your code.

(In "consumers" I also include the future you!)

---

# An Aside: `renv`

The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) package, by RSudio, helps you create reproducible environments for your R projects. 

`renv` will make your R projects more (From the `renv` documentation):

- __Isolated__: Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because renv gives each project its own private package library.

- __Portable__: Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. renv makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.

- __Reproducible__: renv records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

For further details, see [this introduction](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

# An Aside: Docker

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/social/docker_facebook_share.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a virtual computer inside your computer.

- Docker makes sure that anyone running your code will be able to perfectly reproduce your results.

- Docker solves a major predictability barrier: replicating your entire development environment (operating system, R versions, dependencies, etc.).

- For further details, see [rOpenSci's tutorial](http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/).

# RStudio Project Environment


- If your R script starts with `setwd()` or `rm(list=ls())` then are [doing something wrong](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)!  

- Instead:
  
  1. Use RStudio's project environment.  
  
  2. Go to `Tools -> Global Options -> General` and set the "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to **NEVER**.


---

# R Markdown

- R Markdown notebooks, by RStudio, are perhaps THE go-to tool for conducting reproducible research in R.

- The process of "knitting" an Rmd file starts with a clean slate.

- An R Markdown file integrates text, code, links, figures, tables, and all that is related to your research project.

- R Markdown is perfect for communicating research. One if its main advantages is that an *.Rmd file is a "meta-document" that can be exported as a:

  - document (word, PDF, html, markdown).
  - presentation (html, beamer, xaringan, power point)
  - website ([`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)).
  - book ([`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/home/)).
  - journal article ([`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown))
  - dashboard ([`flexdashboards`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)).

# The Tidyverse
---------------


---
# This is Not a Pipe

```{r pipe, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/pipe.jpg")

```


---

# Prerequisite: `%>%` is a pipe

- The "pipe" operator `%>%` introduced in the [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) package, is deeply rooted in the `tidyverse`.

- To understand what `%>%` does, try associating it with the word "then".

- Instead of `y <- f(x)`, we type `y <- x %>% f()`. This might seen cumbersome at first, but consider the following two lines of code:

```r
> y <- h(g(f(x), z))

> y <- x %>% f() %>% g(z) %>% h()
```

The second line of code should be read as: "take `x`, _then_ put it through `f()`, _then_ put the result through `g(. , z)`, _then_ put the result through `h()`, and finally, keep the result in y.

---

# Base R vs. the Tidyverse

- Consider the following data frame:
```{r }
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10),
                 y = rnorm(10),
                 z = rnorm(10))
```

- Can you guess what the following code chunk does?
```{r }
df_new <- df[df$x > 0, c("x", "y")]
df_new$xx <- df_new$x^2
```

--

- How about this one?

```{r }
df_new <- df %>% 
  select(x, y) %>% 
  filter(x > 0) %>% 
  mutate(xx = x^2)
```

---

# How to read "piped" code?

```{r }
df_new <- df %>% 
  select(x, y) %>% 
  filter(x > 0) %>% 
  mutate(xx = x^2)
```


The above code chunk should be read as:

>"generate a new dataframe `df_new` by taking `df`, _then_ select `x` and `y`, _then_ filter rows where `x` is positive, _then_ mutate a new variable `xx = x^2`"


---

# Pros & cons

- Following a "tidy" approach makes your code more readable $\Rightarrow$ more reproducible.

- I believe that there is a growing consensus in the #rstats community that we should [learn the tidyverse first](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).

- Nevertheless, note that the tidyverse is "Utopian" in the sense that it strives toward _perfection_, and thus keeps changing. By contrast, base R was built to last.

- As usual, being proficient in both (base R and the tidyverse) will get you far...


---
# The Tidyverse

```{r tidyverse_pic, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/tidyverse.png")

```

---

# Tidyverse Packages

Which packages come with `tidyverse`?

```{r }

tidyverse_packages()

```

Note that not all these packages are loaded by default (e.g., `lubrudate`.)

We now briefly introduce one the tidyvers flagships: `dplyr`.

---

# `dplyr`: The grammar of data manipulation

`dplyr` is THE go-to tool for data manipulation

- Key "verbs":

  - `filter()` - selects observations (rows).
  - `select()` - selects variables (columns).
  - `mutate()` - generate new variables (columns).
  - `arrange()` - sort observations (rows).
  - `summarise()` - summary statistics (by groups).
  
- Other useful verbs:
  
  - `group_by()` - groups observations by variables.
  - `sample_n()` - sample rows from a table.
  

- And much more (see `dplyr` [documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html))


---

# The `tidymodels` package

- Tidymodels extends the tidyverse "grammar" philosophy to modelling tasks.

```{r tidymodels}

tidymodels::tidymodels_packages()

```


For further details, visit the [tidymodels GitHub repo](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels).
