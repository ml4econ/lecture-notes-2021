# Linear Regression

# Econometrics

In econometrics, we typically assume a "true" linear data generating process (DGP):

`$$y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}+\varepsilon_{i}$$`

where `\(y_i\)` is the outcome variable, `\(x_{ij},\ldots,x_{ip}\)` is a set of explanatory or control variables (+ interactions, polynomials, etc.), and `\(\varepsilon_i\)` is the regression error.  

__sample__ : `\(\{(x_1,\ldots,x_p,y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}\)`

---

# Estimation

Ordinary least squares minimizes

`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2}$$`
The emphasis here is on in-sample fit (minimize residual sum of squares).


Typical workflow:
- impose identifying assumptions (causal claims).
- estimate `\(\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_p\)` using the entire sample.
- assume a random sample from a larger population.
- hypothesis testing.


---
# Supervised Learning

Consider the following linear data generating process (DGP):

`$$y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}+\varepsilon_{i}$$`
where `\(y_i\)` is the predicted (response) variable, `\(x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip}\)` is a set of "features", and `\(\varepsilon_i\)` is the irreducible error.  

- __Training set__ : `\(\{(x_{1i},\ldots,x_{ip},y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}\)`
- __Test set__ : `\(\{(x_{1i},\ldots,x_{ip},y_i)\}_{i=n+1}^{m}\)`

&lt;midd-blockquote&gt;
Typical assumptions: (1) independent observations; (2) stable DGP across training _and_ test sets.
&lt;/midd-blockquote&gt;

Our object of interest is `\(\widehat{y}_i\)`, predicting unseen data.


---

# Dffierent objective, different approach

To illustrate how these two approaches (estimation vs. prediction) differ, consider the following data generating process&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i,\qquad \varepsilon_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$`
where `\(\beta_0=0\)` and `\(\beta_1=2\)`.

Next, suppose you get a sample of size `\(N\)` and use it to estimate the model and get (standard errors in parentheses):

`$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;y_{i}=0.0\hspace{0.35cm}+\hspace{0.35cm}2.0\times x_{i}+\widehat{\varepsilon}_{i}\\
&amp;\hspace{1.4cm}(0.2)\hspace{0.85cm}(10.0)
\end{aligned}$$`

Given a new unseen `\(x^0\)` and the output above, how would you predict `\(y^0\)`?

# Standard errors and prediction accuracy

- OLS is lexicographic in the sense that it first ensure unbiasedness, then efficiency.

- OLS is unbiased, hence you would be right _on average_, but. Is that what we want?

- If your estimated coefficient is noisy (high std. error), so will be your prediction (high variability).

- Bias-variance trade off again.

- Prediction is about balancing bias and variance.


__NOTE:__ in multivariate regression, things are more complicated due to the correlation structure of the `\(x\)`'s.

# Illustration: Browse data

In this lecture, we will use Matt Taddy's __browser dataset__ (available in our repo) which contains web browsing logs for 10,000 people. Taddy has extracted a year’s worth of browser logs for the 1000 most heavily trafficked websites. Each browser in the sample spent at least $1 online in the same year.

The goal of estimation: predict spending from browser history:

`$$\log(spend_i) = \beta_0 + \beta'visits_i + \varepsilon_i,\qquad \text{for }i=1,\ldots,n$$`
where `\(visits_i\)` is a vector site-visit percentage. This model can be used to segment expected user budget as a function of browser history.

---

# Load data

In this lecture we will only use a sample from the browser dataset: 250 websites and 1000 users.


```r
browser &lt;- here("05-regression-regularization/data","browser-all.csv") %&gt;% 
  read_csv()
```

Log spending by the first user and the fraction of times she spent on the first 4 websites:

```r
browser[6, 1:5]
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##   log_spend `123greetings.com` `204.95.60.12` `2o7.net` `65.115.67.11`
##       &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      7.74                  0         0.0483    0.0483         0.0322
```

__NOTE:__ The design matrix in this case is sparse.


---

# Data to matrices

We will soon see that it is useful to transform the data to response and features vector and matrix, respectively:

```r
browser_mat &lt;- browser %&gt;% 
  as.matrix()

Y_browser &lt;- browser_mat[, 1]     # response
X_browser &lt;- browser_mat[, 2:201] # features
```

Estimate the model using `lm()`

```r
lm_fit &lt;- lm(log_spend ~ ., data = browser)
```

# Model perfoemance

What is the training-set MSE?


```r
lm_fit %&gt;% 
  augment() %&gt;%
  summarise(mse = mean((log_spend - .fitted)^2)) %&gt;% 
  kable(format = "html", digits = 3)
```

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; mse &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2.075 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This is clearly an _underestimate_ of the test set MSE.

# Penalized linear regression

# Estimation

_Penalized_ (or _regularized_) sum of squares solves

`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2} \text { subject to }R(\beta) \leq t$$`
where `\(R(\cdot)\)` is a penalty function that measures the __expressiveness__ of the model.

As the number of features grows, linear models become _more_ expressive. 


---

# Notation: Norms


Suppose `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` is a `\(p\times 1\)` vector with typical element `\(\beta_i\)`. 

- The `\(\ell_0\)`-norm is defined as `\(||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_0=\sum_{j=1}^{p}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{\beta_j\neq0\}}\)`, i.e., the number of non-zero elements in `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)`.  

- The `\(\ell_1\)`-norm is defined as `\(||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_1=\sum_{j=1}^{p}|\beta_j|\)`.  

- The `\(\ell_2\)`-norm is defined as `\(||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_2=\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p}|\beta_j|^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\)`, i.e., Euclidean norm.  


---
# Commonly used penaltiy functions

It is often convenient to rewrite the regularization problem in the Lagrangian form:

`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2}+\lambda R(\beta)$$`
__NOTE:__ There is one-to-one correspondence between `\(\lambda\)` and `\(t\)`.

|  Method          |  `\(R(\boldsymbol{\beta})\)`             | 
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| OLS              | 0                                    |
| Subset selection | `\(\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_0\)`   |
| Lasso            | `\(\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1\)`   |
| Ridge            | `\(\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_2^2\)` |
| Elastic Net&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;      | `\(\alpha\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1 + (1-\alpha)\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_2^2\)`             |

# Best subset selection

# Our goal


`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2} \text { subject to }\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_0 \leq t$$`

__In words__: select the best model according to some statistical criteria, among all possible combination of `\(t\)` feature or less.

---

#  Best subset selection algorithm

1. For `\(k=0,1, \ldots ,p\)`

 1.1 Fit all models that contain exactly `\(k\)` predictors. If `\(k=0\)`, the forecast is the unconditional mean.
 
 1.2 Pick the best (e.g, highest `\(R^2\)`) among these models, and denote it by `\(\mathcal{M}_{k}\)`.
 
2. Optimize over `\(\{\mathcal{M}_{0}, \ldots, \mathcal{M}_{p}\}\)` using cross-validation (or other criteria) 


Issues:

1. The algorithm is very slow: at each step we deal with `\(p \choose k\)` models ("N-P complete".)
2. The prediction is highly unstable: the subsets of variables in `\(\mathcal{M}_{10}\)` and `\(\mathcal{M}_{11}\)` can be very different from each other, leading to high variance (the best subset of `\(\mathcal{M}_3\)` need not include any of the variables in best subset of `\(\mathcal{M}_2\)`.)


---

# Faster subset selection algorithms

Instead of estimating all possible combinations, follow a particular path of models:

- Forward stepwise selection: start simple and expand (feasible even if `\(p&gt;n\)`)

- Backward stepwise selection: start with the full model and drop features (not recommended)


---

# Forward stepwise algorithm

1. Let `\(\mathcal{M}_{0}\)` denote the null model, which contains just an intercept.

2. For `\(k=0, \ldots, p-1:\)`

  2.1 Consider all `\(p-k\)` models that augment the predictors in `\(\mathcal{M}_{k}\)` with one additional predictor.
  
  2.2 Choose the best among these `\(p-k\)` models, and call it `\(\mathcal{M}_{k+1} .\)` Here best is defined as having highest `\(R^{2}\)`
  
3. Select a single best model from among `\(\mathcal{M}_{0}, \ldots, \mathcal{M}_{p}\)` using cross-validation.

&lt;midd-blockquote&gt;
This is our first example of a __greedy algorithm__: a making the locally optimal selection at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.&lt;/midd-blockquote&gt;

# Stepwise using `gamlr`

.pull-left[
[`{gamlr}`](https://github.com/TaddyLab/gamlr) is an R package that enables you, among other things, to estimate a forward stepwise regression model.


```r
fit_step &lt;- gamlr(X_browser, Y_browser, gamma=Inf, lmr=.1)
plot(fit_step, df=FALSE, select=FALSE)
```
The figure on the right shows the value of the coefficients along the forward stepwise selection path. 

Notice how the jagged are the solution paths. This discontinuity is the cause for instability in subset selection algorithms.

# Shrinkage


---

# Prerequisite: centering and scaling

In what follows, we assume that each feature is centered and scaled to have mean zero and unit variance, as follows:

`$$\frac{x_{ij} - \widehat\mu_i}{\widehat\sigma_{i}}, \qquad\text{for }j=1,2, \ldots, p$$`

where `\(\widehat\mu_i\)` and `\(\widehat\sigma_i\)` are the estimated mean and standard deviation of `\(x_i\)` estimated over the _training_ set.

__NOTE:__ This is not important when using OLS (why?)


---

# The ridge regression

Ridge regression was introduced into the statistics literature by Hoerl and Kennard (1970). 

The optimization problem:
`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2}+\lambda \lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_2^2$$`
or in a budget constraint form:
`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2} \text { subject to }\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_2^2 \leq t$$`

Ridge puts a "budget constraint" on the sum of squared betas. This constraint incorporate the cost of being "too far away" from the null hypothesis of `\(\beta_j=0\)` (what if this assumption is wrong?)

# The solution

The problem in matrix notation:

`$$\underset{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\operatorname{min}}\:\:(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta})^{\prime}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta})+\lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{\beta}$$`
The ridge estimator is given by
`$$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{\text {R}}=\left(\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}+\lambda \mathbf{I}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{y}$$`
__NOTE:__ We can have a solution even if `\(\mathrm{X}\)` is not of full rank (e.g., due to multicollinearity) since `\(\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}+\lambda \mathbf{I}\)` is non-singular (since `\(\lambda&gt;0\)`.)


---

# Bayesian interpretaion of ridge

- Consider the regression
`$$y_{i}\sim N\left(\mathbf{x}_i^{\prime}\boldsymbol{\beta} , \sigma^2\right)$$`
where we assume that `\(\sigma\)` is known.

- Suppose we put an independent prior on each `\(\beta_{j}\)`

`$$\beta_{j} \sim {N}\left(0, \tau^{2}\right)$$`

- Then, the posterior mean for `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` is 

`$$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\text {posterior}}=\left(\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\tau^{2}} \mathbf{1}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{y}$$`

- Hence, `\(\lambda = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\tau^{2}}\)`.

---

# Estimating ridge using `glmnet`

.pull-left[
The [`{glmnet}`](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) R package enables you to estimate ridge regression, along with its path for `\(\lambda\)`. 

(Note that for estimating the ridge, we need to set `alpha`, the elastic net parameter to 0.)

```r
fit_ridge &lt;- glmnet(
  x = X_browser,
  y = Y_browser,
  alpha = 0
)
plot(fit_ridge, xvar = "lambda")
```
The figure on the right shows the ridge __regularization path__, i.e., the values of the (standardized) coefficients for different values of (log) `\(\lambda\)`.

# Pros and cons of ridge

__PROS:__

- when `\(p\)` is large, ridge significantly reduces variance (by introducing bias.)
- works even when `\(p&gt;n\)`.

__CONS:__

- Though ridge shrinks all of the coefficients toward zero, it does not set any of them to exactly zero. Hence, when `\(p\)` is large, interpretation remains a challenge.

# The lasso

Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)  was introduced by Tibshirani (1996). The optimization problem:
`$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2}+\lambda \lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1$$`

Lasso puts a "budget constraint" on the sum of _absolute_ `\(\beta\)`'s. 

Unlike ridge, the lasso penalty is linear (moving from 1 to 2 is the same as moving from 101 to 102.)

A great advantage of the lasso is that performs model selection - it zeros out most of the `\(\beta\)`'s in the model (the solution is _sparse_.)

Any penalty that involves the `\(\ell_1\)` norm will do this.

# Bayesian interpretation of lasso

The prior distribution of `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` under lasso is the double exponential (Laplace) with density `\(1/2\tau \exp (-|\boldsymbol{\beta}| / \tau)\)`, where `\(\tau=1/\lambda\)`. The posterior mode is equal to the lasso solution

# A note about shrinkage

Assume that `\(n=p\)` and `\(\mathbf{X}\)` is an `\(n\times p\)` orthonormal matrix with unit vectors and that we are estimating a regression without an intercept.

Under these assumptions, OLS finds `\(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p\)` that minimize `\(\sum_{j=1}^{p}\left(y_{j}-\beta_{j}\right)^{2}\)`. The solution is `\(\hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}_{j}=y_{j}\)` (that is, a perfect fit, `\(R^2=1\)`.)

Similarly, ridge and lasso estimates take the form
`$$\hat{\beta}_{j}^{Ridge}=\frac{\hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}}{(1+\lambda)},\qquad\qquad \hat{\beta}_{j}^{Lasso}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}-\lambda / 2 &amp; \text { if } \hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}&gt;\lambda / 2 \\
\hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}+\lambda / 2 &amp; \text { if } \hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}&lt;-\lambda / 2 \\
0 &amp; \text { if }\left|\hat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}\right| \leq \lambda / 2
\end{array}\right.$$`
and best-subset selection drops all variables with coefficients smaller than the `\(t^\text{th}\)` largest.

# Shrinkage and its consequences for econometric analysis

Ridge shrinks proportionally, whereas lasso shrinks by a similar amount, and sufficiently small coefficients are shrunken all the way to zero. The lasso type of shrinkage is called "soft-thresholding."

Source: [James et al. (2017) ](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html) 

__Main takeaway:__ We can't just use ridge/lasso coefficients in subsequent econometric analysis (unless you're a Bayesian...)

# Dimensionality reduction

---

# A different approach

__MAIN IDEA:__ Instead of selecting and/or shrinking `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)`, try to find `\(M\)` linear combinations of the `\(x\)`'s, such that `\(M&lt;p\)` and use them to predict `\(y\)`.

---

# Motivating example

Consider the following regression model:

`$$y_i = \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \varepsilon_i$$`

next, define a new variable, `\(f_i\)`, as a linear combination of `\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}\)`:

`$$f_{i} = \lambda_{1} x_{i1} + \lambda_{2} x_{i2}$$`
for some constants `\(\lambda_1\)` and `\(\lambda_2\)`. This "factor" is a lower dimension representation of the feature space (one variable instead of two.)

According to the dimension reduction approach, it might be the case that

`$$\hat{y}_i = \hat\alpha{f}_{i}$$`
(estimated by, say, OLS) would provide better predictions.

---

# How does this relate to penalized regression?

Since

`$$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\alpha} f_i = \hat{\alpha}\lambda_{1}x_{i1} + \hat{\alpha}\lambda_{2}x_{i2},$$`
dimension reduction can be viewed as a method that puts a constraint on the estimated `\(\beta\)`'s, i.e., 

`$$y_i = \beta^{*}_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2^* x_{i2} + \varepsilon_i$$`
where
`$$\beta^{*}_1 = \alpha\lambda_{1}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \beta^*_2 = \alpha\lambda_2$$`

The main challenges here:
1. How to choose (estimate) `\(\lambda_1\)`, `\(\lambda_2\)`?  
2. How many factors to use? (in this case, since `\(p=2\)`, `\(M\)` is at most 2.)

---

# The general case

- Let `\(f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_p\)` represent `\(p\)` linear combinations of the features `\(x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_p\)`, such that 

`$$f_{im} = \lambda_{m1} x_{1i} + \ldots + \lambda_{mp} x_{ip},\qquad \text{for } m = 1,\ldots,p$$`
- The linear model is given by
`$$y_i = \alpha_0 + \sum_{m=1}^{M}\alpha_m f_{im} + \varepsilon_i,\qquad \text{for } i = 1,\ldots,N$$`
where `\(M&lt;p\)`, and is estimated by OLS.

- The main issue is estimating and selecting the number of factors in a way that improves prediction accuracy (i.e., reduce variance with respect to OLS.)

---
# Principal components regression (PCR)

Let `\(\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_p)\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1=(\lambda_{k1},\ldots,\lambda_{kp})\)` denote a vector of features and scalars, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) amounts to:

(1) Find a linear combinations `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1\)` of the elements of `\(\mathbf{x}\)` that maximizes its variance.

(2) Next, find a linear combination `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_2\)` of the elements of `\(\mathbf{x}\)`, uncorrelated with `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_1}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}\)` having maximum variance.
`$$\vdots$$`
`\((p)\)` Finally, find a linear combination `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_p\)` of the elements of `\(\mathbf{x}\)`, uncorrelated with `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_1}^{\prime}\mathbf{x},\ldots,\boldsymbol{\lambda_{p-11}}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}\)` having maximum variance.

&lt;midd-blockquote&gt; `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_k}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}\)` is the `\(k^{\text{th}}\)` __principal component__ (PC), and `\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_k}\)` is the vector of coefficients or __loadings__ for the `\(k^{\text{th}}\)` PC.
 &lt;/midd-blockqoute&gt;

# Illustration: NBC TV pilots data

- To illustrate, we will use Matt Taddy's NBC pilots dataset that include survey responses for focus groups on TV show pilots as well as the first year of ratings results.

- Our objective: predict viewer interest from pilot surveys, thus helping the studios to make better programming decisions.

- The survey data include 6241 views and 20 questions for 40 shows.

- `PE` is our outcome of interest. It measures viewers engagement with the show which is reported on a 0 (no attention) to 100 (fully engaged) scale.

# Wait, But what is the meaning of these "components"?

.pull-left[
Examining the loadings matrix (also known as "rotation matrix") can help us to put label on PCs.

First, we will apply the `prcomp()` function again the the feature matrix and store its output in `pca`.

```r
pca &lt;- X %&gt;% prcomp(scale. = TRUE)
```
Then, we can access the rotation matrix using the `$rotation` handle (we'll only look at the first two components.)

```r
pca$rotation[, 1:2] %&gt;% round(1)

# Notes about PCR, ridge, and lasso


- PCR is an unsupervised method. PCs are extracted without using `\(y\)`. (Can we first extract PCs and _then_ proceed to cross validation? Why?)

- PCR implicitly assumes that that data are _dense_, as opposed to lasso where the data is assumed to be _sparse_.

- (Very wonkish:) Ridge regression can also be interpreted as an algorithm that shrinks PCs of `\(x\)` having small variance. By contrast, PCR leaves `\(M\)` PCs untouched and removes the rest.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

# Sparse PCA (SPCA)

Sparse principal component analysis (Zou, Hastie, and, Tibshirani, 2006) employ lasso type penalties to produce components with many loadings zero. 

SPCA can be estimated using the `spca()` function from the [`{elasticnet}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elasticnet/index.html) package

```r
spc &lt;- spca(
  x = X,
  K = 2,
  type = "predictor",
  sparse = "varnum",
  para = c(10, 10)
)
```
where `type="predictor"` means that the input is a feature matrix (and not, say, a covariance matrix), and where the number of PCs `K` is limited to the first two.

Sparsness on the loadings is imposed by `sparse=varnum` which means that we want to limit the number of non-zero loading parameters and `para = c(4,4)` means that we want that each component will have 4 non-zero loadings.

---
# SPCA results

.pull-left[
Here are the loadings of the first two sparse PCs based on the `spca()` algorithm:  

```r
spc$loadings %&gt;% round(1)
```
We can now proceeds to PCR by tuning `K` and or `para` using cross-validation (not in this lecture.)

# PCR-lasso

Taddy (2019) suggests that instead of tuning the number of principal components, we could try to tune their number using lasso: 
`$$\underset{\alpha_{0}, \alpha}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\alpha_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} 
\hat{f}_{i j} \alpha_{j}\right)^{2}+\lambda \lVert\boldsymbol{\alpha}\rVert_1$$`


---
# Tune each method using cross-validation

We will now compare 3 methods:

1. PCR-lasso for `\(y\)` on `\(f\)`.
2. Lasso for `\(y\)` on `\(x\)`.
3. PCR-lasso for `\(y\)` onto both `\(x\)` and `\(f\)`.


```r
lasso_pcr  &lt;- cv.glmnet(x = PC, y = Y, nfold = 20)
lasso_x    &lt;- cv.glmnet(x = X , y = Y, nfold = 20)
lasso_pcrx &lt;- cv.glmnet(x = cbind(X, PC) , y = Y, nfold = 20)
```

(Which of the above is preferred depends on the application.)

---
# Plot cross-validation results


```r
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(lasso_pcr, sub = "PCR")  
plot(lasso_x, sub = "Lasso")  
plot(lasso_pcrx, sub = "PCR-LAsso")
```

# Partial least squares (PLS)

- In PCR, PCs are extracted in an unsupervised way - we don't use information on `\(y\)` during the process.

- by contrast, partial least squares (PLS) extracts factors in a supervised way.

- In theory, PLS should have an advantage over PCR, it might pick-up features that are highly correlated with `\(y\)` that PCR would drop.

- In practice, when it comes to prediction, there is little difference in most applications.

# The PLS algorithm

For 

(1) Regress `\(y\)` onto each `\(x_j\)` independently, i.e., 
`$$y_i = \phi_{1j} x_{i,j} + \varepsilon_{ij},\qquad \text{for }j=1,\ldots,p$$`
and store `\(\phi_{11},\ldots,\phi_{1p}\)`.

(2) Use the estimated vector of coefficients `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}_1}=(\phi_{11},\ldots,\phi_{1p})\)` to construct a new component `\(v_{i1}\)`, which is a linear combination of the `\(x\)`s:
`$$v_{i1}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}_1}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}_i$$`
(3) Define the residuals from (1) as a new set of features, and proceed to (2) and estimate the second component, `\(v_{i2}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}_2}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}_i\)`.

(4) Continue until you reach the minimum of `\(p\)` or `\(n\)`.

# Run PLS using the `pls` package

.pull-left[
We're no ready to estimate PLS using, wait for it..., the [`{pls}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pls/index.html) package!

```r
cv_pls &lt;- plsr(
  Y ~ X,
  scale = TRUE,
  validation = "CV",
  segments = 10

# Summary

- _"Despite its simplicity, the linear model has distinct advantages in terms of its interpretability and often shows good predictive performance."_ (Hastie and Tibshirani)

- Subset selection is slow, unstable, and infeasible when `\(p\)` is large.

- Ridge provides is fast, works when `\(p&gt;n\)`, provides good predictions, but is hard to interpret (keeps all features in.)

- Lasso is fast, works when `\(p&gt;n\)`, provides good predictions, and performs variable selection.

- Ridge and lasso shrink the parameters of the model, thus, can't be used out-of-the-box for econometric analysis

- Despite their advantages, linear models need lots of bookkeeping (and memory and computing power) when it comes to explicitly adding non-linearities, interactions, etc.
